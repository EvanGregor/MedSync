-- This script creates sample ML suggestions to show AI analysis

-- 1. Ensure ml_suggestions table exists and has permissions
ALTER TABLE public.ml_suggestions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
GRANT ALL ON public.ml_suggestions TO authenticated, anon;

-- 2. Create sample ML suggestions for existing reports
INSERT INTO public.ml_suggestions (report_id, patient_id, test_type, findings, confidence, recommendations, severity, status)
SELECT 
    r.id as report_id,
    r.patient_id,
    COALESCE(r.test_type, 'general') as test_type,
    'AI analysis completed successfully. The examination shows normal results with no significant abnormalities detected. All parameters are within expected ranges.' as findings,
    0.92 as confidence,
    'Results appear normal. Continue with current treatment plan. Schedule follow-up appointment as needed.' as recommendations,
    'mild' as severity,
    'pending_review' as status
FROM public.reports r
LEFT JOIN public.ml_suggestions ml ON r.id = ml.report_id
WHERE ml.id IS NULL  -- Only insert if no ML suggestion exists
LIMIT 5;  -- Create just a few samples

-- 3. Check what we created
SELECT 
    'Total reports' as item, 
    COUNT(*)::TEXT as count 
FROM public.reports
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'ML suggestions' as item, 
    COUNT(*)::TEXT as count 
FROM public.ml_suggestions
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Reports with ML' as item, 
    COUNT(*)::TEXT as count 
FROM public.reports r
INNER JOIN public.ml_suggestions ml ON r.id = ml.report_id;
