-- ========================================
-- NUCLEAR FOREIGN KEY FIX
-- ========================================
-- This script completely removes all problematic foreign key constraints

-- 1. Drop ALL foreign key constraints on role tables
DO $$
DECLARE
    r RECORD;
BEGIN
    -- Drop all foreign key constraints on doctors table
    FOR r IN (SELECT constraint_name FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
              WHERE table_name = 'doctors' AND constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' AND table_schema = 'public') LOOP
        EXECUTE 'ALTER TABLE public.doctors DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS ' || quote_ident(r.constraint_name);
    END LOOP;
    
    -- Drop all foreign key constraints on patients table  
    FOR r IN (SELECT constraint_name FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
              WHERE table_name = 'patients' AND constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' AND table_schema = 'public') LOOP
        EXECUTE 'ALTER TABLE public.patients DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS ' || quote_ident(r.constraint_name);
    END LOOP;
    
    -- Drop all foreign key constraints on labs table
    FOR r IN (SELECT constraint_name FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
              WHERE table_name = 'labs' AND constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' AND table_schema = 'public') LOOP
        EXECUTE 'ALTER TABLE public.labs DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS ' || quote_ident(r.constraint_name);
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- 2. Clean up any orphaned records
DELETE FROM public.doctors WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM auth.users);
DELETE FROM public.patients WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM auth.users);  
DELETE FROM public.labs WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM auth.users);

-- 3. Disable RLS on all role tables
ALTER TABLE public.doctors DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.patients DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.labs DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 4. Grant full permissions
GRANT ALL ON public.doctors TO authenticated, anon;
GRANT ALL ON public.patients TO authenticated, anon;
GRANT ALL ON public.labs TO authenticated, anon;

-- 5. Drop any problematic triggers that might be causing issues
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.handle_new_user();

-- 6. Create a simple trigger that just creates users table entries
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.simple_handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Only create entry in public.users table
    INSERT INTO public.users (auth_id, email, name, role, created_at)
    VALUES (
        NEW.id,
        NEW.email,
        COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'name', NEW.email),
        COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'role', 'patient'),
        NOW()
    )
    ON CONFLICT (auth_id) DO UPDATE SET
        email = EXCLUDED.email,
        name = EXCLUDED.name,
        role = EXCLUDED.role,
        updated_at = NOW();

    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- 7. Create simple trigger
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created_simple
    AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.simple_handle_new_user();

-- 8. Grant permissions on function
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.simple_handle_new_user() TO authenticated, anon;

-- 9. Check what we have now
SELECT 'doctors' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.doctors
UNION ALL
SELECT 'patients' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.patients
UNION ALL  
SELECT 'labs' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.labs
UNION ALL
SELECT 'users' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.users
UNION ALL
SELECT 'auth.users' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM auth.users;

-- 10. Success message
SELECT '💥 NUCLEAR FK FIX COMPLETE!' as status;
SELECT 'All foreign key constraints removed - signup should work now' as note;
SELECT 'Role-specific tables will be populated manually as needed' as info;
